Not to be confused for SaaS (software as a service), this technology is like the updated version of CSS which you can use along side Bootstrap as well as other tools and is not that complicated to understand if you understand CSS.

You can learn SASS through VS Code as you can get the extensions from there and learn how to write in SASS as in VS Code it also creates a CSS file along side.



Why you should learn SASS?
To expand your knowledge on other technologies and frameworks as you get to work on your design skills for web development.

See how its better than writing normal CSS as when you make a SCSS file it makes a CSS file for you that converts everything for the website to understand.



Resources used to learn SASS:
SAAS website: From the actual website you can find the documentation related to SASS

Freecode camp: They have videos on using SASS on youtube which I found useful to practice to write SASS in and explore what it can do.
