PHP server side scripting for websites and web applications, quite a powerful language and if you know it can earn you alot of money.

Some of the sources I used to help learn PHP include;
Sololearn - website/app which goes over the programming language in terms of syntax and what you can do.

Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript- book, quite a technical book which talks above php, MySQL and JavaScript, so it's up to you if you want to get this book

PHP & MySQL - book, similar to the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery book in the HTML, CSS and JS section, so the book would come with different code snippets to try.

Linkedlin Learning - video which goes over different php concepts

Learn PHP a linkendln learning video which goes over different things for php 

Freecode camp - youtube video's which give you examples to do along with the video or for you to watch and learn at the same time.
mmtus - youtube video, provides very helpful PHP video's that build up from beginner to more experienced and explains the code too so you won't be stuck.

For helping to code in PHP and run the code I would recommend using something like Xampp, Lamp or Mampp which is free to download and run on Window's as well as Mac, you don't have to change any settings for them they should work straight away after installation otherwise you may have to unistall skype or disable it when you are trying to run it and any other application using port 80. Xampp will also come with MariaDB so alongside your php you can use a database and make a web application or a site which requires a database to load content from or save to.
